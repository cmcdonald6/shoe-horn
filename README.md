Shoehorn is an app for shoe enthusiasts to easily keep an up-to-date look at their current collection while also getting a general idea of the prices of their shoes. This app can be a central hub for users to hold all the information for their collection efficiently and even compare prices of shoes they want to buy in the future and see trends to know when a good time to buy will be. Shoehorn will work alongside other online marketplaces to compare with current price trends.
